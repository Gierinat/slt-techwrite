1. Keep in mind, not all end user devices support all of these standards and protocols, you as the network designer will be required to identify the least common denominator standard and protocol that meets the needs for everything in the architecture.

2. From a wireless design perspective, the best way to provide sustained performance to a high-density number of clients is to pre-determine and distribute clients across multiple APs and channels. 

3. We have no way to trace the electrons from a website or app back to the power plant where the electricity is being generated and actually know the exact amount of greenhouse gas produced based on those browsing activities.

4. This covers the technologies and designs from a service provider point of view to provide the benefits to the enterprise network architecture if one of these technologies is chosen from a transport perspective.

5. The access-to-distribution data center links rely on link aggregation technologies to quadruple the total available bandwidth. Because each bundle contains four links, the network distributes 25% of north/south traffic across each link. 

6. However, as a network architect, you must evaluate the scenario that you are dealing with, ideally using the top-down design approach, where business goals and requirements are at the top, followed by the application requirements that should collectively drive the functional and technical requirements.

7. Today, content also has to be ready for contextless situations—not only in truncated form when we struggle to make out small text on our smartwatches or scroll through new television series on Roku but also in places it's never ended up before.

8. This is especially true when the network was designed for technologies and requirements relevant in years past and the business decided to adopt new IT technologies and architectures to facilitate the achievement of its goals, but the business’ existing network was not designed to address these new technologies’ requirements.
